	abstract = {A spin 1/2 system on a honeycomb lattice is studied. The interactions between nearest neighbors are of {XX}, {YY} or {ZZ} type, depending on the direction of the link; diﬀerent types of interactions may diﬀer in strength. The model is solved exactly by a reduction to free fermions in a static Z2 gauge ﬁeld. A phase diagram in the parameter space is obtained. One of the phases has an energy gap and carries excitations that are Abelian anyons. The other phase is gapless, but acquires a gap in the presence of magnetic ﬁeld. In the latter case excitations are non-Abelian anyons whose braiding rules coincide with those of conformal blocks for the Ising model. We also consider a general theory of free fermions with a gapped spectrum, which is characterized by a spectral Chern number ν. The Abelian and non-Abelian phases of the original model correspond to ν = 0 and ν = ±1, respectively. The anyonic properties of excitation depend on ν mod 16, whereas ν itself governs edge thermal transport. The paper also provides mathematical background on anyons as well as an elementary theory of Chern number for quasidiagonal matrices.},

	abstract = {We study the relationship between quantum chaos and pseudorandomness by developing probes of unitary design. A natural probe of randomness is the “frame potential,” which is minimized by unitary k-designs and measures the 2-norm distance between the Haar random unitary ensemble and another ensemble. A natural probe of quantum chaos is out-of-time-order ({OTO}) four-point correlation functions. We show that the norm squared of a generalization of out-of-time-order 2k-point correlators is proportional to the kth frame potential, providing a quantitative connection between chaos and pseudorandomness. Additionally, we prove that these 2k-point correlators for Pauli operators completely determine the k-fold channel of an ensemble of unitary operators. Finally, we use a counting argument to obtain a lower bound on the quantum circuit complexity in terms of the frame potential. This provides a direct link between chaos, complexity, and randomness.},
